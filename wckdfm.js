<li class='text-lg'>
<b>Access to Reproductive Health Services:</b> Kamala Harris is fighting for your right to make your own choices about your body and your future. She believes that everyone deserves expanded access to comprehensive reproductive health services. You shouldnâ€™t be pressured into parenthood; you should have the power to decide if and when you want to start a family. Harris is dedicated to ensuring that you have the resources you need, like contraceptives and family planning support, so your life can be on your own terms.

<b>Support for Paid Family Leave for Relatives:</b> Life is complex. Kamala gets that families can look different and you might be caring for relatives or friends who need your support. Thatâ€™s why sheâ€™s focused on creating paid family leave that acknowledges your unique responsibilities. You shouldnâ€™t have to choose between work and supporting those you love. Harris is working hard to secure funding for programs that give you the time and financial backing you need to be there for your familyâ€”and weâ€™ll make sure you feel empowered in your important role.

<h2 class='text-2xl font-bold mb-4'>How Donald Trump Will Hurt You If You Don't Want Children</h2>
<ul class='list-disc pl-5 space-y-3'>
<li class='text-lg'>
<b>Rollbacks on Reproductive Rights:</b> Under Trump, reproductive rights have faced relentless attacks. His administration is determined to roll back access to abortion services, and his efforts to defund Planned Parenthood will strip away critical options for you, making it nearly impossible to make the personal choices that safeguard your autonomy.

<b>Increased Barriers to Contraception:</b> Trump has been relentless in pushing policies that create obstacles to accessing contraception. By allowing employers to deny contraceptive coverage based on their personal beliefs, heâ€™s directly undermining your ability to prevent unwanted pregnancies, putting your health and future in jeopardy.
