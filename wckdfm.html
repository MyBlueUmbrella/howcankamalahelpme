`, "trump": `
<p>If Donald Trump is elected president, he could significantly roll back <b>environmental protections</b> that are critical for combating climate change, increasing your risk of facing extreme weather events and health issues associated with pollution. His administration might also seek to <b>undermine reproductive rights</b>, limiting access to essential healthcare services for young women. Additionally, Trump's policies on <b>student debt</b> are geared towards deregulation and privatization, which could make it harder for you to afford higher education or manage existing loans.

<p>If Donald Trump is elected president, his track record indicates he would likely support policies that <b>favor wealthy developers over renters</b>, resulting in <b>higher rent prices</b> and further <b>stripping away tenant protections.</b> His administration has previously backed tax policies that benefit the real estate market but do little for everyday renters. Additionally, his aggressive dismantling of federal housing assistance programs could lead to an increase in homelessness and displacement, making it even harder for you to find affordable housing.

<p>Donald Trump’s policies would likely <b>exacerbate the housing crisis</b> that many Americans face.
